	<h1>Freehand perspective and drawing in 3D</h1>
	<p>Perspective is something that brings math and geometry to mind, and it doesn’t seem to have anything to do with free, creative drawing you’re interested in. But perspective isn’t only about drawing architecture and vehicles—it applies to all 3D objects, even the living ones. It gives the volume to their bodies, making them look real and 3D on a flat sheet of paper. When you know perspective, you can draw your creatures in all views and poses without any limits—everything you can imagine! And this is what I’d like to teach you today: how to add another dimension to your drawing without making it boring and mathematical.</p>
	<h1>What is Perspective?</h1>
	<p>Let’s start with answering this basic question. A sheet of paper is two dimensional—it has two dimensions, height and width. Together they make a plane: a 2D space where 2D objects can be placed. If you lived on such a plane, you could only go up, down, left, and right.</p>
	<img src="images/2d.png" style="position: relative;">
	<p>The third dimension is depth. It lets you go around within the space made of infinite number of 2D planes stuck together as pages of a book.</p>

	<h1>Test Your Imagination</h1>
	<p>You’ve learned how to draw forms in perspective using guide lines, but now you need to learn to do without them. 
	This is the next step towards the freedom of line! Use both templates once again, but this time draw the forms freely,
	quickly, in a sketchy way, without drawing the skeleton first. Feel free to imagine the guide lines, but don’t draw them.
	Again, accuracy isn’t the goal—just look how sketchy my lines are!</p>

	<h1>Live Perspective Analysis</h1>
	<p>Don’t let tall these cubes, boxes, and ellipsoids fool you—perspective is not only a domain of dead, man-made things. To get a better grasp of how perspective affects live beings, turn animals into simple forms. Fish, snakes, and swimming seals are great for beginning, and when you start feeling comfortable with drawing them, you can tackle every animal in every pose (just don’t get caught in the details). This is a fun exercise and it brings you closer to the real application of perspective.</p>
