<h1>“How to Draw from Imagination.”</h1>
<p>Monika Zagrobelna has become a staple on our blog with her downright amazing posts about how to draw all kinds of animals. She’s thorough and pays attention to the smallest details, but she’s also incredibly thoughtful and creative. We’re going to hear more from her on the SketchBook Blog with a new series called “How to Draw from Imagination.” She kicks it off with an exploration of what it is we actually see in our heads when we draw, and how that can be so different from what ends up on the page. </p>
<p>I’ve always loved drawing animals, but I despised using references for a long time. I wanted to draw freely, without having to search for a photo similar to my vision every time. After all, I had a finished image in my head, so why not simply outline it on paper? So I did. And I ended up with something like this:</p>

<p>But it didn’t work like this. I envisioned a magnificent dragon in my head, with powerful wings, sharp claws, and a furious look in its eyes, and after putting it to paper it looked somehow like this:</p>

<p>Does this story ring a bell? If so, you’ll be glad to hear it has a happy ending. I discovered what my problem was. I discovered what made all these great artists so good. It wasn’t talent—it was practice. And not simply some practice, like drawing everyday waiting for progress to happen. A deliberate kind of practice. Today my dragons look like this, and I plan to be even better yet!</p>
<img src="images/dinosa.jpg">
<p>I have an analytical mind. I always want to know how things work, so I’ve analyzed my process of learning and found out the semi-skills building the big skill of drawing from imagination. These are the following:

<li>Precision: being able to draw intentionally from a reference</li>
<li>Perspective: being able to draw simple forms in 3D from imagination</li>
<li>Knowledge of the subject: being able to recall the features of an object to draw it realistically without a reference</li>
</p>
<p>In this series of articles I will be showing you the exercises and methods to grasp them all, so that you could finally draw what you see in your mind. First, we’ll be tackling precision—the basis of intentional drawing. It’s a kind of a “boring” skill, but because of this people often neglect it, going straight for the more exciting things, like drawing dragons. But you can’t draw a dragon if you can’t draw an intentional line.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Why Drawing From Imagination Is So Hard</h1>
<p>It really seems to be the case—you can see the picture in your head, but when you draw the lines, they turn into a childish scribble. You know exactly what you want to draw, but you can’t draw it. As if your hand didn’t listen to what you tell it to do. However, there’s a deeper explanation for this phenomenon.</p>
<p>
Did you hear that most people can’t draw a bicycle? This experiment reveals a very interesting fact about human psychology. We often think we know what something looks like, but we really don’t. Even if you ride your bicycle everyday to work, you may not know what it looks like. You are just able to recognize it.</p>
<img src="images/bbic.jpg" width="800px">
<p>The goal of evolution is not to create a perfect organism, just an optimal one. And our minds are optimal, too. We don’t need to remember every element of every thing we’ve ever seen. It would be a waste of memory. Knowing the exact proportion between a bear’s head and its paws will not help you survive its attack, neither will the exact knowledge of the bicycle’s mechanism help you ride it any more efficiently. The texture of the tree bark, the exact shape of the clouds, the rhythm of a healthy horse body—there’s no need to carry it all in memory, as long as you can simply recognize it.</p>

<h1>Recognition Is Easy; Recall Is Hard</h1>

<p>Recognition and recall are two very different things. Recognition is quick and simple: you see something, you get certain visual stimulus from seeing it, and you compare this stimulus to something you’ve felt before. Your brain tells you that this stimulus comes from something called  “bicycle”.</p>
<img src="images/draw.png">

<p>But recalling a bicycle is a different thing. It’s an opposite process—you get a name, you recall the stimulus, and you try to recreate the elements that would awake this exact stimulus. You have these elements in your memory, somewhere, but they’re not organized—there was never a need to organize them because recognition is so much easier! Your only way to find the exact set of elements is to shoot in the dark and check what feels right.

	<p>When you have some word on the tip of your tongue, you recall strongly how that word feels; you just can’t recall the actual word, and you’ll recognize it immediately once you hear it (because it gives you the same feeling). This is when the difference between these two processes is the most visible. But you notice it in other situations, too—when your mom changes her haircut and you feel something’s different, but you can’t tell what haircut she had before, or when you’re in the dark about your best friend’s eye color.That feeling of knowing what something looks like comes from comparing a name/a concept to a stimulus. But a stimulus comes from seeing something, not the other way around. That’s where drawing comes to help. You can draw something and check if it gives you the stimulus you were looking for (as if you were saying some words aloud to find the one that’s on the tip of your tongue). Most likely, you will draw the most obvious elements, the ones you consciously know about. But this gives you only a part of the stimulus—just enough to recognize the thing. You are left with the feeling of wrongness.</p>
